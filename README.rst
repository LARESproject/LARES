LARES Lexicon
====

**LARES Lexicon** has been built with EpiDoc Front-End Services (EFES). **EFES** is a free, easy to use, highly customisable platform for the online publication of ancient texts in EpiDoc XML. EFES allows the creation of multiple indices, search and browse interface, geographical visualisation, and integration with linked open data. EFES is a fork of **Kiln**, an open source multi-platform framework for building and deploying complex websites whose source content is primarily in XML.
